            Learning system

1. Flash cards
2. Import text files
3. Export data
4. Entirely offline application
5. Based on indexDB

At this moment it doesn't handle evaluation (like comparing user's answers with real answers)

1. Flash cards
 How a flash card is functioning ?
 - it can be of a certain type :
    - example a small pair of <question, answer>
 - it has level of difficulty regarding learing
 - it contains information regarding time
    - next time it should be seen again
    - last time when it was seen
 - it belongs to a category
 - it contain labels in order to group cards

 System that will manage flash cards
 - group cards based on some labels, keywords;
 - group cards based on time, priority, difficulty


 Define knowledge test that will be used by a flash card

 How to generate testing data from some information:
 - the file that will contain the information can be of form:
    - keywords, certain phrases <=> some text, definition
    - for example learning typescript:
        - concepts, syntax, terminology

 Can throw random tests 

 How the information should look like ?
 - in indexDB the information will be stored in form of key,value pair
 - data will be processed in multiple object stores from multiple perspectives 
 - categories, questions, answers, timings;
 - can support users based on labels 
    - in case of multiple users they can create a label that is the a username on a question , answer 
      so that it grouped by that
- need to implement labels in database


Timing: 
   - last time when saw a question, 
   - next time when I should see a question 
      - is calculated when the level is selected by user

Level of difficulty
   - easy: 
      - if the difference between the current date and last date is less
      then 10 days the next date is calculated as current date plus 7 days
      - if the difference between the current date and last date is bigger 
      then 10 days the next date is calculated by multiplying the difference 
      by 2
   - medium: next time is next 3 days
   - hard: next time is next 1 day
   - needs to be stored only for the purpose of filtering
     if the user wants to see at this moment all difficult questions
   - can be stored as a label




Make a plugin on chrome so that when I subliniate something on text it will save that text on local machine
so that I can import this information into the learning system
